                        problem statements.

                        One of these problem statements was chosen based on its severity, urgency, impact,
                        frequency, and personal choice. A why and how laddering was conducted on this statement to
                        arrive at a draft Solution Devoid Problem Statement (SDPS) (mentioned above)

                        To validate my hypothesis, I conducted additional research on the selected problem area.
                        Through an extensive literature review, market analysis, stakeholder interviews, expert
                        interview, and survey, I narrowed down the factors affecting the success of therapy for a
                        person with mental health issues to factors such as: therapist-patient mismatch, the absence
                        of a structured treatment plan, patient adherence to advice, and the challenge of monitoring
                        progress.

                        Based on the insights, a set of stakeholder requirements were created, prioritised, and
                        tested.

                        resulting in three concepts. These concepts were evaluated against the established
                        requirements and concept 1 was selected based on the results.

                        Testing took place at multiple stages during the project's development. It began by testing
                        the requirements with a therapist, followed by forming a stakeholder review plan and
                        evaluating the conceptual design. The conceptual design underwent iterative improvements
                        based on feedback. Subsequently, the mockups and final storyboards were created. The
                        embodiment design was further refined based on feedback, ultimately leading to the final
                        design intervention.
