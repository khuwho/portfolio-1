                        Initially, we conducted an preliminary literature review with the aim of mapping out customer
                        problems in restaurants, from which we derived multiple problem statements and subsequently
                        applied why and how laddering techniques to identify the root cause of the problem and its
                        impact. This enabled us to construct our Solution Devoid Problem Statement (SDPS).
                        Following this, to validate our previous findings and gain deeper insights into the problem, we
                        conducted interviews with five stakeholders, resulting in the refinement of our final SDPS.

                        tested.

                        for brainstorming solutions. These ideas were then transformed into two distinct concepts. The
